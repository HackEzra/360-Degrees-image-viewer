#Each file/folder will contain the following:

 360.php — We will be able to view 360 images that we have uploaded.

 index.php — This file will be used to upload images and insert the image information into our MySQL database, this is basically our home page.

 delete.php — This file will be used to delete an image from our server and image information from our MySQL database.

 dbconfig.php — We included the dbconfig. php file into the script by using the require_once function. Inside the try block, we created a new PDO object with three arguments: connection string, username, and password. The connection string is composed of $host and $dbname variables in the dbconfig. php file.


#Creating the Database and setting-up Tables
 For this part, you will need to access your MySQL database, either using phpMyAdmin (included with XAMPP) or your preferred MySQL database management application.

If you're using phpMyAdmin follow these instructions:

 Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
 Click the Databases tab at the top
 Under Create database, type in 'image' in the text box
 Select utf8_general_ci as the collation (UTF-8 is the default encoding in HTML5)
 Click Create
 This will create the database we're going to use, now we need to create the table and insert example images, instead of manually doing this we can simply execute the below SQL, just remember to select the 'image' database first and click the SQL tab located at the top.
    
This will create the images table with the following columns:

 id — The unique identitifier of the record.
 image_name — The title of the image.
 short_description — The description of the image.
